This project involves creating a simple quiz system using HTML for the user interface and ASP.NET for server-side processing. The user interface (Quiz.html) will include fields for users to enter their name and student ID, followed by 20 quiz questions on a topic of your choice. These questions will use various HTML form controls, such as select/option lists, radio buttons, and textboxes, to capture user responses. Once the form is submitted, the server-side (QuizResults.aspx) will process the data using the ASP.NET Request object to retrieve the answers. The page will then display detailed feedback for each question, including the question itself, the userâ€™s response, whether the answer is correct or incorrect, and the correct answer when necessary.
